# Transition

## Overview

Transition is an electric-circuit simulator oriented for audio crossover design.

I started this project intended to be as a commercial software for selling. Years later I just decided to give everything up.
It is supposed to be a reborn of the defunct LinearX CrossoverShop

The project is not 100% complete.

## Features

### Current features:
- Full electric circuit design
- All passive RLC components, and custom Impedance.
- FDNR, Potentiomenter, Transformer and Switch components
- Active components like OpAmp, H block, Summer and buffer
- Loudspeaker component, supporting both SPL and Impedance vectorial curves
- Both grounded and differential voltage simulation
- Simulation of Voltage across and Current through every passive component directly
- Simulation of Power of resistors
- Own Docking Window System
- Potentiometer taper library
- OpAmp library
- Full support for floating sections or totally floating circuit.
- Data import via text files
- Opening/Saving files in JSON format

### Features Yet to Be Implemented:
- Digital FIR and IIR filters
- Data Export
- Graph Export
- Printing
- Remove an annoying hint box that shows "Ctrl+F4" message
- Circuit synthesis
- Unary math operations (gain, phase offset, etc..)
- Binary math operations
- Minimum Phase Transform
- Delay Phase Transform
- Fast Fourier Transform

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and open the solution. Only dependence for this project is the ECDockingManager which is a separate project. All other dependences are available via NuGet. Run the project.
